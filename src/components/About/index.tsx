          Hi! My name is Mario and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Ive been
          programming for about 10 years (when Flash sites were very popular).
          Over the past three yeard, I've been extensively working with React
          and NextJs to keep the same language in the backend. In addition to my
          frontend expertise, I have hands-on experience with both relational
          and non-relational databases. In my life I have worked in product and
          service companies in teams with great professionals and diverse web
          and mobile challenges. Always trying to use the latest libraries and
          technologies. I really love to develop software and keep myself
          updated in this exciting field.
